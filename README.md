#Internet Tracker App
this is the front end flutter app for the Internet Tracker backend i made [here](https://github.com/fred441a/internet-tracker)
this is mostly to show my abilities to write php, and flutter with BLoC.
Also a little bit to bust my ISP in messing with my internet.

Set the IP value in ```.env``` to the local IP of your raspberry pi (or other computer running the backend)
